Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
<br><br>

I'm Chris, AKA Zaldre, a DevOps engineer and infrastructure enthusiast who believes in automating the boring stuff so humans can focus on the interesting problems.

## What I Do

- **Infrastructure as Code** - Kubernetes, Ansible and Hybrid Infrastucture architecture design and implementation, both On-Prem and in the cloud
- **Cloud & Container Orchestration** - Making complex systems manageable
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Building robust automation that just works
- **Language Polyglot** - Go, Python, Powershell, C#, Bash, Ansible, English, Thai
- **Security & Secrets Management** - Keeping production safe and compliant


Currently working with Kubernetes at a large distributed scale across Australia and New Zealand and have a healthy obsession with GitOps workflows.

## This Blog

This is where I document my technical adventures, lessons learned (often the hard way), and occasional tom foolery in the world of infrastructure and automation.

Topics you'll find here:
- Kubernetes deep-dives
- Infrastructure automation patterns
- CI/CD best practices
- Designing scalable reliable systems
- The occasional rant about why we over-engineer things

## Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not wrestling with YAML files, you can find me being a coffee nerd (Melbourne life), Spending time with my wife Sandhya and my daughter Zoe, Riding my bike around Melbourne's inner west or enjoying a frosty cold beer at the pub
