Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zaldre, a DevOps engineer and infrastructure enthusiast who believes in automating the boring stuff so humans can focus on the interesting problems.

## What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Kubernetes, Azure DevOps and Hybrid Infrastucture architecture, both on prem and in the cloud
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Building robust automation that just works
- **Cloud & Container Orchestration** - Making complex systems manageable
- **Security & Secrets Management** - Keeping production safe and compliant
- **Language Polyglot** - Go, Python, Powershell, Ansible, English, Thai

Currently working with Kubernetes, Azure, Go, and a healthy obsession with GitOps workflows.

## This Blog

This is where I document my technical adventures, lessons learned (often the hard way), and occasional tom foolery in the world of infrastructure and automation.

Topics you'll find here:
- Kubernetes deep-dives
- Infrastructure automation patterns
- CI/CD best practices
- Cloud architecture
- The occasional rant about why we over-engineer things

## Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not wrestling with YAML files, you can find me being a coffee nerd (Melbourne life), Spending time with my wife Sandhya and my daughter Zoe, Riding my bike around Melbourne's inner west or enjoying a frosty cold beer at the pub
